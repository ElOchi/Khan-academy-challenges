        <p class="Spain-para"><strong>Spain</strong> (Listeni/ˈspeɪn/; Spanish: <em>España</em>

       Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land
       boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and
       to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Along with France and Morocco,
      it is one of only three countries to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.

    <h3>History</h3>
<p class="Spain-para">Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago.
   Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian settlements
   developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which
  the region was named Hispania. In the Middle Ages, the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and
   later by the Moors. Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century, following
    the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the centuries-long
    reconquest, or Reconquista, of the peninsula from the Moors in 1492.
    In the early modern period, Spain became one of history's first global colonial empires,
    leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish
    speakers, making Spanish the world's second most spoken first language,
    after Chinese and before English.
